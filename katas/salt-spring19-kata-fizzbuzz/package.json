  "description": "Let's do the classic FizzBuzz kata described [here](http://codingdojo.org/kata/FizzBuzz/). However, we'll add a small requirement to the original kata. In the response from your module, you should signal to the user __without throwing any errors!__ whether the request was successful or not.  This means that if the users of your fizzbuzz module makes a valid request, they should get a message back that indicates the request was successful and what the result was.  And if they makes an invalid request, e.g. with the argument `-4` or `\"foo\"`, they should get a message back that says there was an error. This means that if the users of your fizzbuzz module makes a request with the argument `-4` or `\"foo\"`, they should get a message that tells them there was an error and some hint about how they can make a correct request.",
