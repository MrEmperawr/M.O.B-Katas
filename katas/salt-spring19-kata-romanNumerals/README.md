# Roman Numerals

Another classic kata. 

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals)
> The numeric system represented by Roman numerals originated in ancient Rome and remained the usual way of writing numbers throughout Europe well into the Late Middle Ages. Numbers in this system are represented by combinations of letters from the Latin alphabet. Roman numerals, as used today, are based on seven symbols:

Symbol | I   | V   | X   | L   | C   | D   | M
---    | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Value  | 1   | 5   | 10  | 50  | 100 | 500 | 1,000

_Note that Roman numerals are not defined for zero or negative numbers!_

## Project Setup
Note: even though this setup is similar to what you've done several times before, don't just copy paste code from previous katas. Try and write it from scratch, that's how you learn! _Repetitio est mater studiorum_.

- Create a new git branch
- Use `npm` to manage the javascript project.
- Configure the project to use `mocha` as testing framework and `eslint` for linting. Use the same linting rules as in the previous projects.

## The Kata
Create a _roman numeral convert_ that converts Arabic numbers to roman numerals. 
Develop the code TDD style.
Make sure it works for all Arabic numbers between 1 and 3000. You don't have to test all numbers, but you have to test enough to be confident you have a working solution.

If you have time, you can also convert in the opposite direction, i.e. convert from Roman numerals to Arabic Numbers.
